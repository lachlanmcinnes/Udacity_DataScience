# Boston Airbnb Prices

This github repository is used to identify how prices can be predicted using the Boston Airbnb Data Set.  By using Python and Jupyter Notebooks we are able to show how the data is represented as well as different graphs showing important information at each stage.

## Motivations
How do we predict prices? If you are someone with an interest in seeing how much you can rent your dwelling on Airbnb this becomes an important question. Why go through all the hassle if the end result leaves you in the negative?

Airbnb has a vast amount of information regarding the locations, dwelling types and prices regarding their listings. As such this is the perfect starting point to see if we are able to predict home prices for short term renting.
